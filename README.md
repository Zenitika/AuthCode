### Important to read!
___
 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ By default, the password for logging in and encrypting data is "space". Be sure to change it in the settings to your new password! When you first enter the application, you do not need to specify anything, just click "Check". Be careful when editing your codes. To delete them, enter the (old) desired code in the first field, and leave the second blank. Just click "Change this code". If both fields are empty and you click "Change this code" then all passwords will be deleted!
